idea:
name: health tracker, health monitor, eye on health, well being.
A Health Tracking Site!
a website where you enter basic health stats like
body temprature, heart rate and your weight (once a week).
enter your workout stats such as:
calories burnt, steps, distance crossed, etc...
set up your calorie intake for the day and count your calories based on that goal.
in the end the goal of this website is to make it easier for you to keep an eye on your
health by making a user friendly UI.
