planning:
---
design the login and register buttons. (not satisfied but complete + might get deleted later)

design a registration page and a login . (Postponed)

build the backend for that (somehow). (Postponed)

desgin the "enter your stats" page. (working on that)

design the "enter a workout" page.

idea : inegrating "myfitnesspal" with this site, meaning the user profile is connected to their myfitnesspal profile. (idk how to do this though...)
